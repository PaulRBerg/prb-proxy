PRBProxy is a **proxy contract that allows for the composition of Ethereum transactions on behalf of the contract owner**, acting as a smart wallet
that enables multiple contract calls within a single transaction. Externally owned accounts (EOAs) do not have this functionality; they are limited to
interacting with only one contract per transaction.

Some key features of PRBProxy include:

- Forwarding calls with [`DELEGATECALL`][se-3667]
- Use of [CREATE2][eip-1014] to deploy the proxies at deterministic addresses.
- A unique registry system ensures that each user has a distinct proxy.
- An access control system that permits third-party accounts (called "envoys") to call target contracts on behalf of the owner.
- A plugin system that enables the proxy to respond to callbacks
- Reversion with custom errors rather than reason strings for improved error handling.
- Comprehensive documentation via NatSpec comments.
- Development and testing using Foundry.

Overall, PRBProxy is a powerful tool for transaction composition, providing numerous features and benefits not available through EOAs.

## Background

The concept of a proxy contract has gained popularity thanks to DappHub, the team responsible for creating the decentralized stablecoin
[DAI](https://makerdao.com). DappHub created [DSProxy](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy), a widely used tool that allows for the execution of
multiple contract calls in a single transaction. Major DeFi players like Maker, Balancer, and DeFi Saver all rely on DSProxy.

However, as the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved since DSProxy's launch in 2017, the tool has become outdated. With significant improvements to the
Solidity compiler and new EVM OPCODES, as well as the introduction of more user-friendly development environments like
[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), it was time for an update.

Enter PRBProxy, the modern successor to DSProxy; a "DSProxy 2.0", if you will. It improves upon DSProxy in several ways:

1. PRBProxy is deployed with [CREATE2][eip-1014], which allows clients to pre-compute the proxy contract's address.
2. The `CREATE2` salts are generated in a way that eliminates the risk of front-running.
3. The proxy owner is immutable, and so it cannot be changed during any `DELEGATECALL`.
4. PRBProxy uses high-level Solidity code that is easier to comprehend and less prone to errors.
5. PRBProxy offers more features than DSProxy.

Using CREATE2 eliminates the risk of a [chain reorg](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Chain_Reorganization) overriding the proxy contract owner, making
PRBProxy a more secure alternative to DSProxy. With DSProxy, users must wait for several blocks to be mined before assuming the contract is secure.
However, PRBProxy eliminates this risk entirely, allowing users to even safely send funds to the proxy before it is deployed.

## Install

### Foundry

First, run the install step:

```sh
forge install PaulRBerg/prb-proxy@release-v4
```

Your `.gitmodules` file should now contain the following entry:

```toml
[submodule "lib/prb-proxy"]
  branch = "release-v4"
  path = "lib/prb-proxy"
  url = "https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy"
```

Finally, add this to your `remappings.txt` file:

```text
prb-proxy/=lib/prb-proxy/src/
```

### Hardhat

PRBProxy is available as an npm package:

```sh
pnpm add @prb/proxy
```

## Usage

There are multiple ways to deploy a proxy:

- Call the `deploy` function.
- Call the `deployFor` function, which accepts the owner as an argument.
- Call the `deployAndExecute` function, which deploys the proxy and executes a delegate call to a target contract in a single transaction.

Once the proxy is deployed, you can start interacting with target contracts by ABI-encoding the target's functions and pass the data to the `execute`
function on the proxy.

### Addresses

The registry and the enshrined target are deployed at the same address on the following chains:

| Contract | Chain                   | [Chain ID](https://chainlist.org/) | Address                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Registry | Ethereum Goerli Testnet | 5                                  | [0xa87bc4C1Bc54E1C1B28d2dD942A094A6B665B8C9](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xa87bc4C1Bc54E1C1B28d2dD942A094A6B665B8C9#code) |

### Targets

To make use of PRBProxy, you need a so-called "target". Target contract consist of stateless scripts and are the key to leveraging PRBProxy for
transaction composition.

As an example, here's a target contract that wraps ETH into WETH (the ERC-20 version of ETH) and deposits the resulting WETH into a DeFi protocol
called Acme:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.8.18 <=0.9.0;

interface AcmeLike {
  function depositCollateral(address token, uint256 collateralAmount);
}

interface WethLike {
  function deposit() external payable;
}

function wrapEthAndDepositCollateral(AcmeLike acme) external payable override {
  uint256 depositAmount = msg.value;

  // Convert the received ETH to WETH.
  WethLike weth = WethLike(0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2);
  weth.deposit{ value: depositAmount }();

  // Deposit the WETH as collateral into the Acme DeFi protocol.
  acme.depositCollateral(address(weth), depositAmount);
}
```

For more examples of target contracts, see the [Targets][targets] wiki.

### Frontends

Integrating PRBProxy into a frontend app is a straightforward process:

1. Begin by calling the `getCurrentProxy` function on the registry to determine if the user already has a proxy.
2. If the user does not have a proxy, ask them to deploy one by calling either the `deploy` or `deployFor` function.
3. Interact with your desired target contract using the `execute` function.
4. Going forward, treat the proxy address as the user of your system.

However, this is just scratching the surface. For more examples of how to use PRBProxy in a frontend environment, check out the [Frontends][frontends]
wiki. Additionally, Maker's developer guide, [Working with DSProxy][dsproxy-guide], provides an in-depth exploration of the proxy concept that can
also help you understand how to use PRBProxy. Just be sure to keep in mind the differences outlined throughout this document.

## Gas Efficiency

It costs 528,529 gas to deploy a PRBProxy, whereas a DSProxy costs 596,198 gas - a reduction in deployment costs of roughly 12%.

The `execute` function in PRBProxy is slightly more expensive than in its counterpart, due to the safety checks in our implementation. However, the
majority of gas costs when calling execute are instead related to the logic being executed in the target contract.
